            <p>
              Well, to introduce myself in James Bond's way :P, people know me by the name Ayush - Arpit Ayush. I am a
              recent MCA graduate from Vellore Institue of Technology, &#40;Chennai&#41; and would like to call myself a
              tech-enthusiast as I like to explore and also work with different technologies. I am a quick learner and I
              can adapt to different technologies quickly, which in my free time helps me to work with Batman and save
              Gotham &#40;Just Kidding&#41;. On a serious note I am an individual who can take care of his assigned
              responsibilities and is honest in his work. I am confident about the current level of skills I possess in
              various aspects of life, but that doesn't stop me from learning, improving and gaining additional
              experience. If you're looking for a competent professional who will add value and make an impact working
              with your organization, I am the person you're looking for.

            <h6 className="text-center">What do I believe in?</h6>
            <p>
              The values I live by are one of the most important aspects of my life. Some of the core values I subscribe
              to are: Respect, Punctuality, Honesty and Hardwork &#40;Even if one has more talent than others&#41;. I
              think one of the most important thing a person should have is the ability to try and grow oneself in
              different areas of life and create a conducive environment to help others present around them grow as
              well.

            <p>
              Playing video games and sports, listening to music are some of my favourite pass time activities. Adding
              to that I also like to go on a ride/drive on weekends or travel to some unvisited,unexplored place. I also
              sometimes like to cook.
